# movencoder2 Refactoring Progress (Type-Safe Config & Error Handling)

Last updated: (auto generated) 
Branch: feature/type-safe-config (based off `work`)

## Scope Completed So Far

1. Introduced type-safe configuration layer
   - Added `METypes.h` with `MEVideoCodecKind` enum.
   - Added `MEVideoEncoderConfig` as a lazy adapter over legacy `videoEncoderSetting` (dictionary).
   - Migrated MEManager accesses for: codec name, bitrate, frame rate, WxH, PAR, encoder options, x264 / x265 params, clean aperture.
   - Added parsing & normalization: bitrate strings (e.g. `2.5M`, `800k`).
   - Added trimming/cleanup for x264 / x265 params (strip whitespace & leading/trailing colons).

2. Validation & issues reporting
   - Collects soft validation issues inside `MEVideoEncoderConfig.issues`.
   - One-time summary log (verbose only) + per-issue debug logs.
   - De-duplication of issues; added warnings for invalid / zero bitrate.

3. Error handling improvements
   - Added `MEErrorFormatter` to unify FFmpeg error code -> readable string mapping and NSError formatting.
   - Integrated formatter for:
     - `avcodec_open2` failure
     - Filter graph creation failures (buffer source/sink, pixel format set, init, parse, configure).

4. Thread-safety adjustments
   - Provided synchronized getter/setter for atomic `videoEncoderConfig` (resolved warning about custom getter only).

5. Logging policy refinements
   - Config summary once per lifecycle (guarded by `configIssuesLogged`).
   - Detailed issue lines use `SecureDebugLogf` (requires `--verbose`).

## Not Yet Done / Pending (Future Phases)

| Area | Pending Tasks |
|------|---------------|
| Validation | Stronger semantic checks (e.g. mutually exclusive params, numeric range checks). |
| Error Handling | Apply `MEErrorFormatter` to more FFmpeg return sites (frame alloc, send/receive frame, buffer add). |
| Pipeline Refactor | Split MEManager into distinct components (FilterPipeline / EncoderPipeline / SampleBufferFactory). |
| State Management | Consolidate filter/encoder flags into a single state struct / state machine doc. |
| Tests | Add unit tests for config parsing, bitrate normalization, issue collection. |
| Docs | Architect diagram & pipeline state doc (planned: `docs/dev/architecture.md`). |
| CLI | Potential `--dump-config` or `--stats` option (not started). |
| Performance | Back-off tuning for EAGAIN, metrics collection. |

## How to Resume Work

When you are ready to continue, you can give one of the following directives:

Examples:
- "Refactor: split MEManager into FilterPipeline and EncoderPipeline (next phase)."  
- "Add unit tests for MEVideoEncoderConfig (bitrate parsing, issue generation)."  
- "Extend MEErrorFormatter usage to avcodec_send_frame / avcodec_receive_packet error logs."  
- "Document architecture: create docs/dev/architecture.md with pipeline/state diagrams."  
- "Implement --dump-config CLI option that prints normalized encoder config."  

If you want a quick status recap first:
- Command: "Show current refactor status" (I will summarize from this file).

## Suggested Immediate Next Step (Minimal Risk)
1. Add lightweight unit tests for `MEVideoEncoderConfig` (ensures no regressions before deeper structural refactors).
2. Then proceed to extract a `MEFilterPipeline` class (move: prepareVideoFilterWith + pullFilteredFrame logic).

## Branch & Merge Notes
- Current branch: `feature/type-safe-config` (not yet merged into `work`).
- Ensure no parallel changes to `videoEncoderSetting` assumptions before merging.
- After adding tests, consider merging this phase to reduce divergence.

## Changelog Summary (for future PR)
- feat(config): type-safe video encoder config and codec kind enum
- refactor(config): migrated MEManager to use typed config (fps/bitrate/size/PAR/options/params)
- feat(config): bitrate string parsing + validation issue logging
- feat(error): MEErrorFormatter integration (encoder + filter graph)
- fix(thread-safety): synchronized getter/setter for videoEncoderConfig

```
git log work..feature/type-safe-config --oneline
```
To rebase onto latest work before continuing:
```
git checkout feature/type-safe-config
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/work
```
To start next refactor phase (example):
```
# Example: begin pipeline extraction
# (You would then request: "Extract filter pipeline from MEManager")
```

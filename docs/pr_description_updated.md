# Updated PR Description

## Problem

When exporting a QuickTime movie using AVAssetWriter, temporary files with patterns like `output.mov.sb-94f28a92-xDAs6Q` may remain in the same directory as the output file even after successful export completion. This results in:

- Unnecessary disk usage from leftover temporary files
- User confusion seeing multiple similar files with nearly identical sizes and timestamps
- Manual cleanup burden on user workflows

## Solution

This PR implements automatic detection and cleanup of AVAssetWriter temporary files after successful export completion with optimized performance and safety features.

### Implementation Details

**Detection Logic (Optimized Processing Order):**
1. **Pre-sorted Processing**: All files are sorted by modification timestamp (most recent first) before validation
2. **Timestamp Validation First**: Files are checked for modification time within the last 1 minute (fast operation)
3. **Pattern Matching Second**: Only timestamp-valid files are checked for filename patterns (efficient)
   - Must start with the output filename as a prefix, AND
   - Must contain `.sb-` in the filename (AVAssetWriter's temporary file identifier)
4. **Modern API**: Uses `contentsOfDirectoryAtURL:includingPropertiesForKeys:options:error:` for efficient attribute retrieval

**Example:**
```
sample.mov.sb-94f28a92-xDAs6Q  ✅ Cleaned up (matches pattern & recent)
sample.mov.sb-abc123-XyZ789    ✅ Cleaned up (matches pattern & recent) 
sample.mov.bak                 ❌ Preserved (no .sb- pattern)
other.mov.sb-123456-AbCdEf     ❌ Preserved (different prefix)
old.mov.sb-999999-OldFile      ❌ Preserved (older than 1 minute)
```

**Integration:**
The cleanup is triggered only in the success path of `METranscoder`'s export completion, ensuring no interference with failed exports or existing error handling.

### Safety Features

- **Non-destructive:** Only affects files matching the exact AVAssetWriter temporary file pattern
- **Time-bounded:** Only removes files modified within the last 1 minute (conservative safety measure)
- **Optimized validation:** Timestamp check before filename pattern check (avoids unnecessary string operations)
- **Pre-sorted processing:** Files processed in timestamp order for predictable behavior
- **Modern API usage:** Efficient URL-based file operations with pre-fetched attributes
- **Comprehensive error handling:** Graceful failure handling with detailed logging
- **Zero impact:** No changes to existing export logic or public API

### Files Modified

- `movencoder2/METranscoder+Internal.h` - Added method declaration
- `movencoder2/METranscoder.m` - Added optimized cleanup implementation and integration
- `docs/temp_file_cleanup.md` - Added comprehensive documentation with implementation history
- `.gitignore` - Updated to exclude test files

### Performance Optimizations

The implementation underwent several performance optimizations based on code review:

1. **URL-based API**: Switched from path-based to URL-based file operations for better performance
2. **Pre-sorting**: All files sorted by timestamp before validation (eliminates redundant sorting)
3. **Validation order**: Timestamp validation before filename validation (avoids string ops on old files)
4. **Concatenated conditions**: Simplified filename pattern matching into single conditional
5. **Reduced time window**: Conservative 1-minute window instead of 10 minutes for precision

The final implementation uses modern Objective-C APIs and follows optimized processing patterns, addressing the exact issue with surgical precision while maintaining zero impact on existing functionality.
